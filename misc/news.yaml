            icon: "table_chart",
            type: "switch",

            helper: {
              text: "This settings requires not app reload/start", // string.thisHelpText
            },
          },
    ```


    # HWPlugin Changes

    Plugins are now context isolated, they cannot access to the Android and Windows interface anymore

    > Due the new context change some elemens variables not work. Is recommended to open an issue.

    Examples

    ```js
    // Windows
    console.log(window.Windows.readFile("plugins.yaml"));

    // Android
    console.log(window.Android.readFile("plugins.yaml"));
    ```

    # Version

    You can get and require an version

    Get

    ```js
    native.version.get; // 1.4.0
    ```

    Require is a little build different, It returns an boolean, not an string or number.

    ```js
    if (native.version.require(140)) {
      console.log("This version is supported");
    } else {
      console.log("You need the 1.4.0 version to make the plugin running");
    }
    ```

    ## Methods to initialize the plugin

    ```js
    (function () {
      const plugin = new HWPlugin("PluginName");
    })();
    ```

    ```js
    initFile(() => {
      const plugin = new HWPlugin("PluginName");
    });
    ```

    Run `initFile()` and your plugin will directly created

    ```js
    initFile((plugin) => {
      plugin.loadCSS({});
    });
    ```

    ## Console

    Console logs form plugins will now marked as an plugin log

    Example

    ```log
    HighContrastPlugin: Author of this project is Der_Googler
    ```

    ## Onsen UI

    The core of Onsen UI is now available in the plugin state

    Example

    ```js
    ons.notification.alert("Button is tapped!");
    ```

    ## NOTICE

    If you're using an bundle builder, (like Webpack) don't use `require` if you want to use require use `pluginName.require`
